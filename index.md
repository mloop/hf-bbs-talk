Welcome to my talk about Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and whether their use of evidence-based beta blockers has the same apparent effects as the clinical trials.

For this talk, you can look at the [slides](talk.pdf), as well as the accompanying [handout](handout.pdf). The handout should contain all of the major information you might need to have on hand as you listen to the talk. For example, all of the key figures I will base my conclusions on are included in the handout.
