Welcome to my talk about Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and whether their use of evidence-based beta blockers has the same apparent effects as the clinical trials.

For this talk, you can look at the [slides](talk.pdf), as well as the accompanying [handout](handout.pdf). The handout should contain all of the major information you might need to have on hand as you listen to the talk. For example, all of the key figures I will base my conclusions on are included in the handout. 

### During the talk

If you have a question, you can fill out the poll [here](https://PollEv.com/free_text_polls/GLpyFwBeiu6JP6JFkpluc/respond). I will review all of the questions at the end of the talk, time-permitting.

I will also be asking you to generate some ideas about what the limitations of this study were. When the time comes, you can submit what you think the limitations were [here](https://PollEv.com/free_text_polls/OYaSM6zJEv5fVOtu12BQO/respond).

### After the talk

The results I discussed can be found in peer-reviewed manuscripts [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cardfail.2018.10.005), [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233161), and [here](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/JAHA.117.007785).
