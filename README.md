Take-aways:

1. Medicare beneficiaries do not seem to *fill* prescriptions as often as we thought, which was based on data of providers *prescribing* them.
2. Among Medicare beneficiaries with HFrEF, who have many comorbidities, increasing beta blocker use may not cause a big decrease in overall hospitalizations.
